/**
 * Wrapper class for the MyImporter plugin.
 * This is an example on how to build plugins for OpenDiabetes.
 * The wrapper class MyImporter is needed for the plugin framework PF4J to load this plugin.
 * It is necessary that there is a class extending org.pf4j.Plugin that has an inner class marked as @Extension
 * Make sure that this inner class is named in the convention plugin.id+Importer, you can specify your plugin id in plugin.properties.
 * Moreover make sure your inner class implements the OpenDiabetesPlugin interface, also it should implement one of the following Interfaces:
 * Importer, Exporter, Interpreter
 * appropriately.
 * If your plugin uses plugin specific libs that are not included in the OpenDiabetes base,
 * put them in the libs folder to include them in your compiled plugin.
 * You should also provide a default configuration named <plugin.id>.properties and provide a helpfile help.md
 * In this example we extend from the more specific AbstractFileImporter that already implements the OpenDiabetesPlugin interface.
 * once you are finished writing/wrapping your new code as plugin for OpenDiabetes run the ant target "package".
 * Afterwards you will find your compiled plugin in the MyPlugin folder.
 * Put the zip file into the plugin folder of the OpenDiabetes Program (currently /export) to use the plugin.
